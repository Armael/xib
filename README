This is the first release of xib so some things are not implemented yet, if you want/need an error-safe bot, don't use this one !

Here is the list of the important things that still need to be implemented:
- handle kicks
- handle multiple bridges without risk of resource conflict

and a list of features that should be implemented but are not critical for usual use case:
- split logs into multiple files
- handle password-protected rooms
- handle room deletion and muc server reboot

xib includes its own version of the old irclib.py <http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net/> because this library doesn't correctly handle the different character encodings, I'm sorry about it but I don't have time to contribute to the upstream version right now, I don't know if it still has developers anyway

xib depends on:
- python 2.6
- xmppony 0.1
