> Introduction

This is the first release of xib so some things are not implemented yet, if you want/need an error-safe bot, don't use this one !

Here is the list of the important things that still need to be implemented:
- handle kicks
- handle multiple bridges without risk of resource conflict

and a list of features that should be implemented but are not critical for usual use case:
- split logs into multiple files
- handle password-protected rooms
- handle room deletion and muc server reboot

xib includes its own version of the old irclib.py <http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net/> because this library doesn't correctly handle the different character encodings, I'm sorry about it but I don't have time to contribute to the upstream version right now, I don't know if it still has developers anyway


> xib dependencies:
- python 2.6
- xmppony 0.1


> Contributors:
Changaco <changaco@changaco.net>


> Changelog:
0.1.1:
 - fixed bug that prevented the bot from connecting to freenode and all other servers that don't send "umode"
 - added optional parameter to start_bots_from_xml_config.py
0.1: Initial release


> How to install and run xib bots:

If you are not installing xib from a package manager I suggest you put the files in /usr/local/share/xib
To start xib bots just execute "start_bots_from_xml_config.py", this script takes the path to a configuration file as optional first parameter, if no such parameter is given it will search the *current* directory for a file named "config.xml".


> How to write a configuration file understandable by "start_bots_from_xml_config.py":

Copy "example_config.xml" and modify it to fit your needs.


> How to log xib bots output:

xib does not directly handle logging for now so you have to do it the old school way, for example:
mkdir /var/log/xib
touch /var/log/xib/1.log
cd /usr/local/share/xib && ./start_bots_from_xml_config.py 1>/var/log/xib/log 2>&1 &
